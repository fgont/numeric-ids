    <t>
Poor selection of transient numerical identifiers in protocols such as the TCP/IP suite has historically led to a number of attacks on implementations, ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) to data injection and information leakage that can be exploited by pervasive monitoring.  To prevent such flaws in future protocols and implementations, this document updates RFC 3552, requiring future RFCs to contain analysis of the security and privacy properties of any transient numeric identifiers specified by the protocol.

<section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
<t>
Network protocols employ a variety of transient numeric identifiers for different protocol entities, ranging from DNS Transaction IDs (TxIDs) to transport protocol numbers (e.g. TCP ports) or IPv6 Interface Identifiers (IIDs). These identifiers usually have specific properties that must be satisfied such that they do not result in negative interoperability implications (e.g., uniqueness during a specified period of time), and an associated failure severity when such properties not met.
</t>

<t>The TCP/IP protocol suite alone has been subject to variety of attacks on its numerical identifiers over the past 30 years or more, with effects ranging from Denial of Service (DoS) or data injection, to information leakage that could be exploited for pervasive monitoring <xref target="RFC7258"/>. The root of these issues has been, in many cases, the poor selection of identifiers in such protocols, usually as a result of insufficient or misleading specifications. While it is generally trivial to identify an algorithm that can satisfy the interoperability requirements for a given identifier, there exists practical evidence <xref target="I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-history"/> that doing so without negatively affecting the security and/or privacy properties of the aforementioned protocols is prone to error.</t>

<t>For example, implementations have been subject to security and/or privacy issues resulting from:

<list style="symbols">
<t>Predictable TCP sequence numbers</t>
<t>Predictable transport protocol numbers</t>
<t>Predictable IPv4 or IPv6 Fragment Identifiers</t>
<t>Predictable IPv6 IIDs</t> 
<t>Predictable DNS TxIDs</t>
</list>


Recent history indicates that when new protocols are standardized or new protocol implementations are produced, the security and privacy properties of the associated identifiers tend to be overlooked and inappropriate algorithms to generate such identifiers are either suggested in the specification or selected by implementers. As a result, advice in this area is warranted.
</t>
<t><xref target="issues"/> provides an overview of common flaws in the specification of transient numeric identifiers. <xref target="vulns"/> provides an overview of the implications of predictable transient numeric identifiers. Finally, <xref target="reqs"/> provides key guidelines for protocol designers.

<section title="Terminology" anchor="terminology">
<t>
<list style="hanging">
<t hangText="Transient Numeric Identifier:">
<vspace blankLines="0" />A data object in a protocol specification that can be used to definitely distinguish a protocol object (a datagram, network interface, transport protocol endpoint, session, etc) from all other objects of the same type, in a given context. Transient numeric identifiers are usually defined as a series of bits, and represented using integer values. These identifiers are typically dynamically selected, as opposed to statically-assigned numeric identifiers (see e.g. <xref target="IANA-PROT"/>). We note that different identifiers may have additional requirements or properties depending on their specific use in a protocol. We use the term "transient numeric identifier" (or simply "numeric identifier" or "identifier" as short forms) as a generic term to refer to any data object in a protocol specification that satisfies the identification property stated above.
</t>

<t hangText="Failure Severity:">
<vspace blankLines="0" />The consequences of a failure to comply with the interoperability requirements of a given identifier. Severity considers the worst potential consequence of a failure, determined by the system damage and/or time lost to repair the failure. In this document we define two types of failure severity: "soft" and "hard".
</t>


<t hangText="Hard Failure:">
<vspace blankLines="0" />A hard failure is a non-recoverable condition in which a protocol does not operate in the prescribed manner or it operates with excessive degradation of service. For example, an established TCP connection that is aborted due to an error condition constitutes, from the point of view of the transport protocol, a hard failure, since it enters a state from which normal operation cannot be recovered.
</t>

<t hangText="Soft Failure:">
<vspace blankLines="0" />A soft failure is a recoverable condition in which a protocol does not operate in the prescribed manner but normal operation can be resumed automatically in a short period of time. For example, a simple packet-loss event that is subsequently recovered with a retransmission can be considered a soft failure.

<section title="Issues with the Specification of Transient Identifiers" anchor="issues">
<t>A recent survey of transient numerical identifier usage in protocol specifications and implementations <xref target="I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-history"/> revealed that most of the issues discussed in this document arise as a result of one of the following conditions:

<list style="symbols">
<t>Protocol specifications that under-specify the requirements for their identifiers</t>
<t>Protocol specifications that over-specify their identifiers</t>
<t>Protocol implementations that simply fail to comply with the specified requirements</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>A number of protocol implementations (too many of them) simply overlook the security and privacy implications of identifiers. Examples of them are the specification of TCP port numbers in <xref target="RFC0793"/>, the specification of TCP sequence numbers in <xref target="RFC0793"/>, or the specification of the DNS TxID in <xref target="RFC1035"/>.</t>

<t>On the other hand, there are a number of protocol specifications that over-specify some of their associated protocol identifiers. Similarly, <xref target="RFC2460"/> suggested the use of a global counter for the generation of Fragment Identification values, when the interoperability properties of uniqueness per {Src IP, Dst IP} could be achieved with other algorithms that do not result in negative security and privacy implications.</t>

<t>Finally, there are protocol implementations that simply fail to comply with existing protocol specifications. That is, appropriate guidance is provided by the protocol specification (whether the core specification or or an update to it), but an implementation simply fails to follow such guidance. For example, some popular operating systems (notably Microsoft Windows) still fails to implement transport-protocol port randomization, as specified in <xref target="RFC6056"/>.</t>

<t>Clear specification of the interoperability requirements for the transient numeric identifiers will help identify possible algorithms that could be employed to generate them, and also make evident if such identifiers are being over-specified. A protocol specification will usually also benefit from a security and privacy analysis of the transient numeric identifiers they specify, to prevent the corresponding considerations from being overlooked.

<section title="Common Flaws in the Generation of Transient Identifiers" anchor="vulns">

<t>This section briefly notes common flaws associated with the generation of transient numeric identifiers. Such common flaws include, but are not limited to:
<list style="symbols">
<t>Employing trivial algorithms (e.g. global counters) that result in predictable identifiers</t>
<t>Employing the same identifier across contexts in which constancy is not required</t>
<t>Re-using identifiers across different protocols or layers of the protocol stack</t>
<t>Initializing counters or timers to constant values, when such initialization is not required</t>
<t>Employing the same increment space across different contexts</t>
<t>Use of flawed pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).</t>
</list>
</t>

<t>
   Employing trivial algorithms for generating the identifiers means
   that any node that is able to sample such identifiers can easily
   predict future identifiers employed by the victim node.</t>

<t>
   When one identifier is employed across contexts where such constancy
   is not needed, activity correlation is made made possible.  For
   example, employing an identifier that is constant across networks
   allows for node tracking across networks.
</t>

<t>
   Re-using identifiers across different layers or protocols ties the
   security and privacy of the protocol re-using the identifier to the
   security and privacy properties of the original identifier (over
   which the protocol re-using the identifier may have no control
   regarding its generation).  Besides, when re-using an identifier
   across protocols from different layers, the goal of of isolating the
   properties of a layer from that of another layer is broken, and the
   privacy and security analysis may be harder to perform, since the
   combined system, rather than each protocol in isolation will have to
   be assessed.
</t>

<t>
   At times, a protocol needs to convey order information (whether
   sequence, timing, etc.).  In many cases, there is no reason for the
   corresponding counter or timer to be initialized to any specific
   value e.g. at system bootstrap. Similarly, there may not be a need for the difference between successive counted
values to be a predictable.
</t>


<t>
   A node that implements a per-context linear function may share the
   increment space among different contexts (please see the "Simple
   Hash-Based Algorithm" in <xref target="I-D.irtf-pearg-numeric-ids-generation"/>).
   Sharing the same increment space allows an attacker that can sample
   identifiers in other context to e.g. learn how many identifiers have
   been generated between two sampled values.
   </t>
   
<t>Finally, some implementations have been found to employ flawed PRNGs. See e.g.<xref target="Klein2007"/>.</t>
